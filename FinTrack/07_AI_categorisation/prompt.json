  "prompt": "Below is a list of bank transactions exported from a sqlite database. Please follow these instructions:\n\n1. Categorize each transaction using ONLY the following categories: Haushold, Electricity, Maitenance, Rent, Salary, Bank loan, Taxes and Fees, Insurance, Leisure, Creditcard, Medicine, Sport, Clothing, Travel, Transportation, ATM, Other.\n2. Use only 'booking_text', 'sender_receiver', and 'purpose' from each transaction to create keywords and assign categories.\n3. Each keyword must be unique and assigned to only one category.\n4. Each unique keyword shall appear only once within the given category.\n5. For each transaction, create only one keyword.\n6. If a transaction does not fit any category, assign it to 'Other'.\n7. Each category must appear only once in the JSON list. If multiple transactions belong to the same category, group all their keywords together in a single object for that category.\n8. Output the result as a JSON list of objects, each with a 'Category' and a list of 'Keywords'.\n9. Do not use any categories other than those listed above.\n10. Disregard letter capitalisation when generating keywords and categories (e.g. ROSSMANN shall be identical to Rossmann).\n11. If you find the word ROSSMANN in the booking_text or sender_receiver, please categorize it as 'Haushold'.\n12. If you find the word FRISCHEPARADIES in the booking_text or sender_receiver, please categorize it as 'Haushold'.\n13. If you find the word BABY WALZ in the booking_text or sender_receiver, please categorize it as 'Haushold'.\n14. If you find the word ERNSTINGS FAM in the booking_text or sender_receiver, please categorize it as 'Haushold'.\n15. If you find the phrase DT. APOTHEKER U. ÄRZTEBANK in the booking_text or sender_receiver, please categorize it as 'Medicine'.\n16. If the purpose field contains leisure-related keywords (e.g., \"coffee\", \"restaurant\"), always assign \"Leisure\" category, regardless of other fields.\n17. If the booking_text field contains \"Kartenzahlung\", do not assign \"Bank loan\".\n18. When generating keywords, use only the main store or company name, not the full transaction text.\n19. If both fields are ambiguous, assign 'Haushold'.\n20. Examples:\n\nbooking_text: \"Kartenzahlung\", purpose: \"Sips coffee\" -> Category: \"Leisure\"\nbooking_text: \"Kartenzahlung\", purpose: \"\" -> Category: \"Haushold\"\nbooking_text: \"\", purpose: \"Loan repayment\" -> Category: \"Bank loan\"\nbooking_text: \"SEPA Lastschrift\", sender_receiver: \"1423 ERNSTINGS FAM.WIEN\" -> Category: \"Haushold\"\nbooking_text: \"SEPA Überweisung\", sender_receiver: \"DT.
